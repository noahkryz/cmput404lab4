Q2. The browser shows you a webpage that says "The install worked successfully! Congratulations!" and shows a rocket ship
Q3. When you navigate to /, it gives an error saying "Page not found at /"
		When you navigate to /polls, it displays a page with the text "Hello, world. You're at the polls index."
Q4. Django migration is when you make a change to the models and so you tell the database that you have made changes 
and updating the schema with the new changes
Q5. I see a site with Authentication and Authorization, with the groups and users, as well as the Polls section
that has the Choices and Questions header under it
In order to get a model to appear in the admin page, after you have added it to the models.py, you add the following text
to the admin.py:
admin.site.register(<model_name>)
Q6. When you go to /polls/38: "You're looking at question 38."
		/polls/38/results : "You're looking at the results of question 38."
		/polls/38/vote : You're voting on question 38.
		When you put a string instead of a number, it gives an error because it is of type <int:question_id>
		You can change this from int to str, and it will let you put alphabetic characters
Q7. You would need to change the hardcoding whenever you change the template, and this is a lot of work,
especially if you have a lot of templates
Q8. It is smarter to use it because it is reusing code for simple tasks, rather than having to write it on your own
It would be smarter to use a generic view when it is a smalller and simpler task
